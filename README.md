<h2> Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Drum Kit:</strong> A web page that simulates a drum kit with buttons that produce different drum sounds when clicked or when corresponding keys are pressed on the keyboard. </li>
  <li><strong>Button Press Detection:</strong> The JavaScript code detects button clicks on the drum buttons using event listeners, and plays the corresponding drum sound using the HTML5 Audio API. </li>
  <li><strong>Keyboard Press Detection:</strong> The JavaScript code also detects keyboard presses using the event listener for "keypress" events, and plays the corresponding drum sound based on the pressed key. </li>
  <li><strong>Button Animation:<strong> The JavaScript code adds a "pressed" class to the drum button when it is clicked or pressed, and removes it after a short delay to create a visual animation effect.
 </li>
  
</ul>
<h2> How to Use:</h2>

  <li>Open the HTML file in a web browser. </li>

 <h3>Note: </h3> The drum sounds are stored as MP3 files in the "sounds" directory, and are played using the HTML5 Audio API in the JavaScript code.</h2>
